<h3>My Situation</h3>
<p>In this class, I have slipped so many times that earning an A is now impossible.  I am starting to regret joining this class because of my previous desires.  Summer school has also impacted me in this class because of its assignments.  The reason I had to join it was that my class schedule was full for next semester.  It has recently ended and I have earned an A in it, but I feel terrible for my grade in this class.</p>
