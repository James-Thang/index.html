    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is James Thang and I am still in high school.  Norwalk High is the school I attend to.  Despite being in high school, I can take this class because of its Dual Enrollment program.  One of my favorite things to do is running because it keeps me active.  I also like to volunteer in my community because I enjoy helping other people out.  I rarely make pizza, but it surprisingly tastes okay.  Hopefully, I can do well in this class by attending all zoom meetings and submitting assignments well before their due date.</p>
    <h2>When I have free time</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Running</li>
            <li>Eating</li>
            <li>Sleeping</li>
        </ol>
    <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://app.schoology.com/login">Schoology</a> because it is very important to have it for submitting assignments in high school.</p>
