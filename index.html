    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>My name is James Thang.  I am attending Norwalk High School and the next school year will be 10th grade for me.  I am also attending Cerritos College by way of my schoolâ€™s Early College Program and Dual Enrollment.  Currently, the biggest issue I face is my time management.  I know that finishing schoolwork at the last minute would risk missing small things that are worth most of its grade.  Some methods I am committing to include thinking the work has to be done eventually and having a planner.  My assignments from my class in summer school along with this class magnifies the problem, but it expands my capacity to complete work.  I hope I can eliminate it before the next school year starts.</p>
